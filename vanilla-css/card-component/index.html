      <h3>Tribute to Coding</h3>
      <p>Coding is more than just lines of logic—it’s a tribute to human creativity, problem-solving, and the relentless
        pursuit of building something meaningful from nothing. Each function written, every algorithm optimized, and
        each bug resolved is a quiet salute to the thinkers and tinkerers who dared to teach machines to understand us.
        In a world shaped by digital innovation, coding stands as the modern-day language of progress, turning
        imagination into reality, one keystroke at a time.</p>
